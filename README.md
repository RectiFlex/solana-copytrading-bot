# Solana Autonomous Meme-Coin Trading Bot

A powerful and autonomous trading bot built in **C#/.NET 8** for the **Solana blockchain**. This bot has been completely refactored from a copy-trading system to an **autonomous strategy** that discovers, analyzes, and trades meme-coins without relying on other wallets.

## 🚨 Complete Refactor Notice

**This repository has been completely transformed** from a copy-trading bot to an autonomous trading system. All copy-trading functionality has been removed and replaced with sophisticated autonomous trading strategies.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Autonomous Discovery
- **Real-time pool detection** via Helius WebSocket monitoring of DEX programs
- **Flow scanning** from data vendors to identify tokens with unusual volume/inflow patterns
- **Candidate scoring** with TTL management and automatic cleanup

### Three Trading Sleeves
1. **Scalps (70% allocation)**: Target new pools < $200k market cap
   - Entry: 3 green 15s candles + rising net inflow + buyer/seller ratio ≥ 1.3
   - Exit: Take profit at +20%/+40%/+80%, hard stop-loss at -100%

2. **Momentum (20% allocation)**: $10M-$100M market cap range
   - Entry: Rising volume + price > VWAP + EMA trend + expanding net inflow
   - Exit: Take profit at +40%/+80%/+120%, trailing stop from high

3. **Swing (10% allocation)**: High conviction trades
   - Entry: Deep liquidity + higher low + MA20 reclaim + sustained inflow
   - Exit: Take profit at +100%/+200%/+400%, de-risk on decay

### Comprehensive Risk Management
- **Hard stop-loss** at -100% per position (no position can lose more than its initial size)
- **Daily drawdown limits** (default 5% of bankroll)
- **Per-token exposure caps** (default 3% of bankroll)
- **Loss streak cooldowns** (30-minute timeout after 3 consecutive losses)

### Advanced Safety Guards
- **Honeypot detection** via simulation
- **Liquidity validation** (minimum $50k LP)
- **Holder distribution checks** (minimum 30 holders in 10m)
- **Concentration limits** (top 10 holders < 45%)
- **LP pull protection** (block if >15% LP removed in 10m)
- **Data freshness monitoring** (block trades if feeds stale)

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **.NET 8** with C# 12
- **Solnet** for Solana RPC/WebSocket communication
- **Entity Framework Core** with SQLite for persistence
- **Refit** for HTTP API clients (Jupiter, Birdeye)
- **Serilog** for structured logging
- **ASP.NET Core** for health endpoints and monitoring

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- Helius API key for RPC and WebSocket access
- Solana wallet (keypair file or environment variable)
- Optional: Birdeye API key for enhanced market data

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your Helius endpoints and wallet settings
   ```
3. Export environment variables (see `docs/Helius-and-env-setup.md` for details)
4. Build the solution: `dotnet build`
5. Start with paper trading: `dotnet run --project src/CLI -- paper`

### CLI Commands
- `paper` - Paper trading with simulated fills
- `start [--yes]` - Live trading (⚠️ requires wallet setup and real funds)
- `watch` - Live market monitoring
- `test` - System tests for API connectivity
- `show-balances` - Display wallet SOL and token balances
- `ensure-atas` - Ensure associated token accounts exist
- `canary` - Run a small test trade to validate pipeline
- `help` - Show command help

### Live Trading Setup
**⚠️ WARNING: Live trading uses real money! Start with paper trading first.**

1. **Get a Helius API key** from [helius.dev](https://helius.dev)
2. **Create or import a Solana wallet**:
   ```bash
   # Create new wallet
   solana-keygen new -o my-wallet.json
   
   # Or use existing wallet
   cp ~/.config/solana/id.json my-wallet.json
   ```
3. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set Helius endpoints
   export Helius__Http="https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY"
   export Helius__Ws="wss://atlas-mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY"
   
   # Set wallet (option 1: file)
   export WALLET__SOURCE=File
   export WALLET__KEYFILE=/absolute/path/to/my-wallet.json
   
   # Or wallet (option 2: environment variable)
   export WALLET__SOURCE=Env
   export WALLET__PRIVATE_KEY_JSON="[1,2,3,...]"  # Contents of wallet JSON
   ```
4. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/CLI -- show-balances
   dotnet run --project src/CLI -- ensure-atas
   ```
5. **Start live trading**:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project src/CLI -- start --yes
   ```

For detailed setup instructions, see `docs/Helius-and-env-setup.md`.

## 📊 Trading Strategy Details

### Entry Criteria by Sleeve

**Scalps** (fast, small positions):
- New pool detected OR significant flow signal
- 3 consecutive green 15-second candles
- Rising net inflow over 1-3 minutes
- Buyer/seller ratio ≥ 1.3
- Optional: Price above EMA(9) > EMA(20)

**Momentum** (medium-term trends):
- 3 periods of rising 5-minute volume
- Price above VWAP(30m) and EMA(20) trending up
- Net inflow positive and expanding over 10-20 minutes
- Rising unique buyer count

**Swing** (high conviction):
- Deep liquidity pool (2x minimum threshold)
- Higher low formation + MA(20) reclaim
- Sustained positive net inflow over 2-6 hours
- Optional: Volume squeeze breakout

### Exit Management
All sleeves enforce the **-100% hard stop-loss**. Additional exits include:
- **Take profit levels**: Laddered exits at predefined profit targets
- **Trailing stops**: Lock in profits on momentum trades
- **Stall detection**: Exit if momentum fades (scalps only)
- **Time-based exits**: Maximum holding periods
- **Concentration monitoring**: Exit if whale activity increases

## 🛡 Risk Management

### Position-Level Risk
- **Maximum loss per position**: 100% of position size (hard coded)
- **Position sizing**: Dynamic based on sleeve allocation and confidence
- **Exposure limits**: Maximum 3% of bankroll per token

### Portfolio-Level Risk
- **Daily drawdown limit**: 5% of total bankroll
- **Sleeve allocation**: 70% scalps, 20% momentum, 10% swing
- **Concurrent position limits**: 6 scalps, 3 momentum, 2 swing
- **Cool-down periods**: 30 minutes after 3 consecutive losses

### Data & Execution Risk
- **Feed monitoring**: Block new trades if data feeds are stale
- **Simulation**: Optional pre-trade simulation via Jupiter
- **Slippage protection**: Adaptive slippage based on volatility
- **Retry logic**: Smart retry with increasing slippage tolerance

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

The bot tracks comprehensive metrics:
- **Daily P&L** by sleeve and overall
- **Win/loss ratios** and average trade size
- **Maximum drawdown** and recovery periods
- **Execution quality** (slippage, fill rates)
- **Discovery effectiveness** (candidate → trade conversion)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Migration from Copy-Trading
This bot **NO LONGER** supports copy-trading functionality. Key changes:
- **Removed**: Wallet monitoring, transaction mirroring, smart-money following
- **Added**: Autonomous discovery, technical analysis, risk management
- **Configuration**: Completely new configuration structure

### Risk Disclaimer
- **Educational purposes only** - use at your own risk
- **Cryptocurrency trading** carries significant financial risk
- **Meme-coins** are highly volatile and speculative
- **Start with paper trading** to understand the system
- **Never risk more than you can afford to lose**

### Development Status
This implementation provides end-to-end live trading capability:
- ✅ **Core architecture**: Complete and functional
- ✅ **Discovery system**: Implemented with simulation
- ✅ **Trading strategies**: All three sleeves implemented
- ✅ **Risk management**: Comprehensive safety systems
- ✅ **Wallet integration**: Solana keypair support with env/file loading
